<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement:
While researching facilities provided to the hearing-impaired individuals, we identified a significant gap impacting those who are both uneducated and hearing impaired, making it hard for them to engage with digital platforms independently. 
Therefore, we came up with the idea which aims to create a machine learning solution for classifying digits through sign language. This can address important areas of daily transactions and communication. In the future we plan to extend this project further to interpret words and sentences that will improve online interaction for the deaf community.

## What makes this project interesting?
An ML solution that will be able to help people with disabilities makes me interested in the project. This project will provide us an opportunity to learn about not only related to IT field but also linguistics and psychology.
